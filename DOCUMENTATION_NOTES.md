# Documentation Implementation Notes

## Notable Design Decisions Discovered

During the documentation process, several important design decisions were identified that reflect thoughtful consideration for the application's educational and neurodiversity-focused use case:

### 1. Temporal Correlation Analysis (`getSensoryMoodCorrelation`)

**Design Decision**: 2-hour correlation window for linking sensory inputs to emotional responses.

**Rationale**: This timeframe strikes a balance between capturing genuine correlations while avoiding false positives from unrelated events. For neurodiverse students, sensory overwhelm can have delayed emotional impacts, but extending the window too far would introduce noise from unrelated activities.

**Implementation Impact**: The sliding window approach examines each sensory log and searches forward through subsequent logs, which requires chronologically ordered data but provides accurate temporal relationships.

### 2. Multi-layered Pattern Detection (`detectPatterns`)

**Design Decision**: Four distinct pattern detection algorithms operating on different timescales.

**Rationale**: 
- **Acute patterns** (2-hour window): Identifies immediate crises requiring intervention
- **Weekly patterns** (recurring day-specific moods): Captures systemic issues like "Monday anxiety"
- **Sensory overload detection**: Prevents sensory overwhelm before it leads to emotional distress
- **Causal relationships**: Identifies specific environmental triggers

**Implementation Impact**: This multi-faceted approach provides educators with both immediate alerts and long-term insights, supporting both crisis intervention and proactive planning.

### 3. Dual-track Visualization (`TimeStateCorrelation`)

**Design Decision**: Separate Y-axis tracks for emotional states vs. sensory inputs.

**Rationale**: This design choice allows educators to visually identify temporal patterns between sensory experiences and emotional responses. The scatter plot format reveals daily rhythms that might be missed in traditional timeline views.

**Implementation Impact**: The dual-track approach requires careful data transformation (decimal hours, separate value tracks) but provides intuitive visual correlation analysis for educators who may not have statistical training.

## Code Quality Patterns Established

1. **Comprehensive JSDoc**: All functions now include purpose, parameters, return values, exceptions, and usage examples
2. **Inline Comments**: Focus on *why* decisions were made, not just *what* the code does
3. **Domain-specific Language**: Comments use educational and neurodiversity terminology appropriate for the target audience
4. **Error Handling Documentation**: Explicit mention of data requirements and failure modes

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Consistency**: Follow the established JSDoc format for all new functions
2. **Context-aware Comments**: Continue emphasizing the educational/neurodiversity context in comments
3. **Example-driven Documentation**: Include realistic examples that reflect actual use cases
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Document design patterns as they emerge to maintain architectural consistency
